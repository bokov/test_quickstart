Description: These are the CI test scripts for the RipCord rapid deployment 
  system for R informatics projects (https://github.com/bokov/ripcord). 
  RipCord is launched by running a GitHub-hosted script via URL from inside an
  R session. It then copies itself over to the current folder, asks the user
  some questions about the location of their data-files, and writes 
  configuration files accordingly. Because of this deployment strategy, RipCord
  needs to be tested externally, to simulate a user pulling it into an existing
  (possibly but not necessarily empty) directory. The ci_parent_test.R script 
  does this by creating subdirectories, copying auto-response scripts to allow
  batch execution, and then pulling RipCord into each of these directories.
